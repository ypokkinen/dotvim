vimrepo
=====
I keep my entire ~/.vim directory within a git repository stored here. What this does is give me the ability to go to a shiny new box and say git clone https://github.com/ypokkinen/dotvim and have my entire vim environment exactly the way I want it.




I am Yrj√∂ Pokkinen, a linux advocate and user since 2004.
